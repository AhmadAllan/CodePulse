**Project Idea:** Online Code Collaboration Platform

**Name:** *CodePulse*
**Description:** Develop a web-based code collaboration platform that allows developers to work
together on coding projects in real-time. The platform should provide features for code editing,
version control, real-time collaboration, and communication tools to enhance teamwork and
productivity.

## Requirements 
1- User Registration and Authentication: Allow users to create accounts and log in securely to
access the code collaboration platform.

2- Code Editing: Implement a code editor with syntax highlighting and code completion for
popular programming languages. Provide a user-friendly interface for writing and editing
code.

3- Version Control: Integrate a version control system (e.g., Git) into the platform, allowing users
to create branches, commit changes, and merge code seamlessly. Display a visual
representation of the commit history.

4- Real-time Collaboration: Enable multiple users to work on the same codebase
simultaneously. Provide features like real-time code synchronization, cursor tracking, and
highlighting changes made by collaborators.

5- Chat and Discussion: Include a chat or discussion feature where collaborators can
communicate with each other in real-time. Allow for private and group conversations to
facilitate effective communication during development.

6- Code Review: Implement code review functionality where collaborators can provide
feedback, suggest changes, and comment on specific sections of code. Support inline
comments and discussions.

7- Project Management: Provide a dashboard where users can manage projects, create tasks,
assign tasks to collaborators, and track progress. Include features like task status updates and
deadlines.

8- Notifications: Send notifications to users for code changes, comments, and project-related
updates to ensure everyone stays informed.

9- Code Sharing and Forking: Allow users to share their code publicly or privately with others.
Provide an option to fork or clone existing projects for further development.

10- Deployment: Deploy the platform to a cloud platform or hosting service, making it accessible
to users from different devices.
